<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We value your privacy. Our game uses Google Firebase services to improve the gaming experience.</p>
<p>Currently, we use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous gameplay data, such as levels played and game launch frequency.</p>
<p>In the future, we may use other Firebase services such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Crashlytics – to track and fix unexpected crashes</li>
  <li>Remote Config – to update game parameters without releasing a new version</li>
  <li>Cloud Messaging – to send optional in-game notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>No personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or phone number) is collected, stored, or shared.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to opt out of analytics tracking, please contact us at gzhhong@gmail.com.</p>
